🧠 Section 1: Programming and Systems
Q1: Python Backtester
A vectorized mean-reversion strategy backtester on minute-level OHLCV data.

Features:

Slippage and transaction cost simulation

Execution latency emulation

Volatility-scaled position sizing

Output: Performance plot and metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, CAGR, turnover, hit rate)

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backtester
python backtester.py
Q2: C++ Tick Aggregator
High-performance CSV tick data aggregator to custom bar size (e.g., 13s).

Optimized for low latency and memory.

Includes unit tests and benchmarks.

Build & Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd cpp_tick_aggregator
make all
./test_aggregator
./benchmark
🤖 Section 2: Machine Learning for Finance
Q3: Feature Engineering
Constructed a predictive feature matrix using:

Order book imbalance

Trade flow imbalance

Volatility clustering

Microstructure features

Evaluated short-term price direction prediction with:

F1-score

AUC-ROC

Open in Jupyter:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ml_feature_engineering
jupyter notebook feature_engineering.ipynb
Q4: Deep RL Limit Order Agent
Implemented DQN-based agent in a Gym-style order book simulator.

Agent learns to:

Join/cancel/cross the spread

Evaluation:

PnL, Fill Ratio, Adverse Selection Ratio

Run training:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd rl_limit_order_agent
python run_training.py
📐 Section 3: Quantitative Theory & Math
Q5: Kelly Fraction with Autocorrelation
Derived optimal leverage under Gaussian returns and serial correlation.

Discussed effects of positive autocorrelation.

See: quant_math/kelly_autocorrelation_derivation.pdf

Q6: Granger Causality in Matrix Form
Matrix-form derivation for multivariate time series.

Adapted test for non-stationary financial series.

See: quant_math/granger_matrix_form.pdf

📊 Section 4: Research & Risk Management
Q7: In/Out-of-Sample Sharpe Drop
Identified 5 potential causes of edge degradation.

Suggested diagnostic and remediation approaches.

See: research_notes/edge_degradation_analysis.md

Q8: Monitoring and Risk Control
Live strategy monitoring plan

Real-time anomaly detection (PnL, signals)

Risk response framework for position/volatility

See: research_notes/production_monitoring_plan.md

🧱 Section 5: Bonus Challenge – System Architecture
Q9: Multi-Agent AI Trading System
Designed scalable architecture with:
